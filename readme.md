# Computer Science Curriculum & RPG-Engine

## About Me
Professional transition from **Key User / Clerk in the Energy Industry** to **Software Development**. 
My background in critical infrastructure drives my focus on reliability, data integrity, and structured problem-solving.

## Goal
Building a text-based Solo-RPG engine from scratch using C#. 
Focus: **Deep Understanding > Fast Results.**

## Core Philosophy
- **System Stability:** Using Try-Patterns and Guard Clauses to prevent crashes (Critical Infrastructure Mindset).
- **Memory Efficiency:** Understanding Stack vs. Heap; using StringBuilder for mutable operations.
- **Clean Architecture:** Single Responsibility (Tokenizer vs. Parser) and "Source of Truth" patterns.

## Repository Structure

### [Semester 01](./Semester_01/) - Computer Science Basics
- **Low Level:** Hardware, Binary System, Memory (Stack/Heap).
- **Logic:** IPO-Model, Control Flow, Guard Clauses.
- **Final:** Building a robust Tokenizer with State-Machine logic (Quotes handling).

### [Semester_02](./Semester_02/) - Advanced System Architecture
- **OOP Basics:** Classes vs. Objects, Reference Types.
- **Security:** Encapsulation ("Field = Safe, Property = Counter"), Invariants, and Valid-by-birth objects.
- **Performance:** Dictionary Lookups (O(1)) and Master Data (Registry) vs. Transactional Data (Inventory).
- **Pattern:** Advanced Try-Pattern for fail-safe parsing.
